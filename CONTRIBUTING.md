# Contributing to the Glazelab web app

Thank you for helping. Bug reports, ideas and changes are welcome as GitHub issues and pull requests.

## Before you open a pull request

- Read `AGENTS.md`: the architecture, the code rules and the hard rules (security, privacy, data) this repository keeps.
- Keep a change small and focused, and add tests for the behaviour it changes.
- Run the checks before you push (Node 22 or later): `npm run format`, then `npm run build` (format check, type check,
  Vitest and the production build). After a UI change, also run the browser tests of the flows you touched:
  `npm run e2e -- <spec file>` (they start the packaged API: a `backend/` checkout next to this repository built with `mvn -DskipTests package`, or
  `GLAZELAB_E2E_JAR` pointing at the jar).

## Licence of contributions

The Glazelab web app is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3 or later (`AGPL-3.0-or-later`, see `LICENSE`).
Your contribution is licensed under the same terms. There is no contributor licence agreement: instead, every commit
carries a sign-off under the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) below, which states that you have the right to submit
it.

Sign off each commit with `git commit -s` (or `--signoff`). Git then adds a line with the name and address of your
Git identity:

```text
Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>
```

Use your real name or the name you are known by, and an address you can be reached at. To sign off commits you already
made, use `git commit --amend -s` for the last one or `git rebase --signoff <base>` for several.
